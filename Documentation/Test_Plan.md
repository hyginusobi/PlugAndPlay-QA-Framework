# Test Plan – Plug & Play QA Framework

## 1. Introduction
This test plan defines the strategy for validating applications using the Plug & Play QA Framework. It integrates OWASP API security testing, WCAG 2.1 accessibility validation, and CI/CD automation to ensure secure, inclusive, and continuously tested applications.

## 2. Objectives
- Detect and prevent common API vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Validate accessibility compliance for inclusive user experiences (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Automate QA checks within CI/CD pipelines for continuous assurance
- Provide clear, reproducible test cases and reports

## 3. Scope
### In Scope
- API endpoints (authentication, authorization, data exposure)
- Web application UI (login, forms, navigation)
- Accessibility features (labels, keyboard navigation, contrast)
- CI/CD pipeline integration (GitHub Actions)

### Out of Scope
- Full penetration testing
- Manual usability studies
- Native mobile apps

## 4. Test Strategy
### 4.1 OWASP API Security
- Broken Authentication: Ensure endpoints reject unauthenticated requests
- BOLA: Validate users cannot access other users’ data
- Excessive Data Exposure: Confirm APIs return only necessary fields

### 4.2 WCAG Accessibility
- Labels & Inputs: Ensure form fields have associated labels
- Keyboard Navigation: Validate operability via keyboard
- Color Contrast: Check text/background contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### 4.3 CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated test execution on every commit
- Fail builds if critical security or accessibility tests fail
- Generate reports for visibility in GitHub Actions

## 5. Test Deliverables
- Test Cases: Stored in `TestCases/`
- Automation Scripts: Located in `automation/tests/`
- Reports: Generated by pytest and GitHub Actions
- Documentation: Test Plan, Service Brochure, Accessibility Strategy

## 6. Entry & Exit Criteria
### Entry
- Application endpoints available
- Test environment configured
- Dependencies installed (`requirements.txt`)

### Exit
- All critical OWASP and WCAG tests executed
- CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- Reports generated and reviewed

## 7. Risks & Mitigation
- Risk: Limited test coverage for complex APIs  
  Mitigation: Expand test suite iteratively  
- Risk: Accessibility checks may miss advanced scenarios  
  Mitigation: Combine automated + manual reviews  
- Risk: CI/CD failures block deployments  
  Mitigation: Allow non-critical warnings but enforce critical test failures

## 8. Schedule
- Day 1–30: Initial setup and prototype
- Day 31–60: Expand test coverage and CI/CD integration
- Day 61–90: Deliver case study and service offering

## 9. References
- OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks (2023)
- WCAG 2.1 Accessibility Guidelines
- GitHub Actions Documentation

## 10. Conclusion
This Plug & Play QA Framework ensures applications are secure, accessible, and continuously validated. It is designed to be lightweight, reusable, and easy to adopt by NHS Trusts, SMEs, and public sector organisations.
